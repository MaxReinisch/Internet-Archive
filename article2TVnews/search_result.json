It\u2019s ranked as high as No. 23 among free news apps on Apple, according to CNN Money.\n\nApple did remove some of Jones\u2019 podcasts from iTunes, while YouTube, which is owned by Google, removed his channel.\u00a0\n\n\u201cApple does not tolerate hate speech, and we have clear guidelines that creators and developers must follow to ensure we provide a safe environment for all of our users,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cPodcasts that violate these guidelines are removed from our directory making them no longer searchable or available for download or streaming. We believe in representing a wide range of views, so long as people are respectful to those with differing opinions.\u201d\u00a0\n\nA growing list of other tech companies \u2015 including Spotify, Facebook, Stitcher and, most recently,\u00a0LinkedIn and Pinterest\u00a0\u2015 have removed some of Jones\u2019 content, saying it violated hate speech policies.\u00a0\n\nYet his accounts on Instagram, Twitter and Periscope (which is owned by Twitter) are still up and running, and several of his movies are still available on Amazon.\u00a0Twitter said the\u00a0content didn\u2019t violate its guidelines.\n\n\nInstagram, which is owned by Facebook, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nJones has responded to the shutdowns by slamming the social media platforms as \u201clying bullies.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThe war on your mind is in full swing as globalists remove outlets of liberty and truth, starting with the tip of the spear: Alex Jones,\u201d a statement on his website read.\nJones also appealed to President\u00a0Donald Trump for help on Monday, asking him to make a bigger deal of the fact that the globalists and the Chinese were trying to steal the 2018 midterm elections.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cIf you come out before the midterms and make the censorship the big issue of them trying to steal the election. And if you make the fact we need an Internet Bill of Rights, and antitrust-busting on these companies, if they don\u2019t back off right now,\u201d Jones said.\u00a0\n", "title": "Alex Jones' Infowars Still Not Banned On App Stores, Instagram And Twitter"}
