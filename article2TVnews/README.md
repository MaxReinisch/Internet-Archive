### Files:

The jupyter notebook files (.ipynb) are used for testing.  All relevant code
has been refactored into `prototype_1.1.py`.

### Instructions:

To run the program, simply call:


`python prototype_1.1.py <article_url>`



Currently, the program only works with huffingtonpost articles.  This will be
extended later on.
